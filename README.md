rhtml-parse
=============

If you need crawl and parse a html content, but you found that some html content is rendered by ajax or rendered 
by script code, now you may feel helplessness on how to get the real html content.

This project will solve this problem, it will parse the html content and automatic render it, then give a clean complete
html content.

I will not write a browser by myself, this project just use some existing libraray to solve this problem. 
I use this library:

  * Rhino
  * Envjs
